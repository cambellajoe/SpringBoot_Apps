This repo contains a series of Apps from different learning materials

Prerequisites before running any of the below projects
* A favorite text editor or IDE (I used VS Code)

**Demo App**<br />
This a basic website from [baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-start).<br />
The app manages a simple Book management system which allows you to execute different CRUB Operaions.<br />
The app can be tested by either use of Postman or by use of testing code under the test directory.<br />

**crud_rest_api**<br />
This project demonstrates creation of rest APIs and their corresponding CRUD operations.<br />
The information and code is sourced from  https://www.javaguides.net/2021/10/spring-boot-crud-rest-api-project-using-IntelliJ-IDEA.html<br />
The app exposes APIs and persists data in a MySQL database.<br />
You need to install and create a mysql database, update the application.properties file with your connection details.<br />
You can find postman test examples under the test directory / postman_test.<br />
